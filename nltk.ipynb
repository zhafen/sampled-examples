      "We use a particle tracking analysis to study the origins of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), separating it into (1) accretion from the intergalactic medium (IGM), (2) wind from the central galaxy, and (3) gas ejected from other galaxies.\n",
      "Our sample consists of 21 FIRE-2 simulations, spanning the halo mass range $M_{\\rm h} \\sim 10^{10}-10^{12}$ M$_{\\odot}$, and we focus on $z=0.25$ and $z=2$.\n",
      "Owing to strong stellar feedback, only $\\sim L^\\star$ halos retain a baryon mass $\\gtrsim50\\%$ of their cosmic budget.\n",
      "Metals are more efficiently retained by halos, with a retention fraction $\\gtrsim50\\%$.\n",
      "Across all masses and redshifts analyzed $\\gtrsim 60\\%$ of the CGM mass originates as IGM accretion (some of which is associated with infalling halos).\n",
      "Overall, the second most important contribution is wind from the central galaxy, though gas ejected or stripped from satellites can contribute a comparable mass in $\\sim L^\\star$ halos.\n",
      "Gas can persist in the CGM for billions of years, resulting in well mixed-halo gas.\n",
      "Sight lines through the CGM are therefore likely to intersect gas of multiple origins.\n",
      "For low-redshift $\\sim L^\\star$ halos, cool gas ($T<10^{4.7}$ K) is distributed on average preferentially along the galaxy plane, however with strong halo-to-halo variability.\n",
      "The metallicity of IGM accretion is systematically lower than the metallicity of winds (typically by $\\gtrsim 1$ dex), although CGM and IGM metallicities depend significantly on the treatment of subgrid metal diffusion.\n",
      "Our results highlight the multiple physical mechanisms that contribute to the CGM and will inform observational efforts to develop a cohesive picture.\n",

      "% Broad intro\n",
      "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies is inferred to contain a baryonic mass comparable to or in excess of the galaxy mass~\\citep[e.g.][]{Werk2014,Tumlinson2017}.\n",
      "This large reservoir of gas, loosely defined as the gas immediately outside the galaxy but inside the dark matter halo, interfaces strongly with the galaxy:\n",
      "accretion onto the galaxy is necessary to sustain galaxy growth over the age of the Universe \\citep[e.g.][]{Prochaska2009, Bauermeister2010},\n",
      "and in turn material from the galaxy returns to the CGM in the form of galactic winds driven by stellar and AGN feedback \\citep[e.g.,][]{Heckman2000, Steidel2010, Jones2012, Rubin2014, Cicone2014}.\n",
      "For recent reviews of the CGM see \\cite{Putman2012}, \\cite{Tumlinson2017}, and~\\cite{Fox2017}.\n",
      "\n",
      "% Simulations\n",
      "Building a theoretical framework for the CGM requires accurately modeling both galaxies and their larger environment.\n",
      "One way to approach this problem is through cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation~\\citep[e.g.][]{Somerville2015}.\n",
      "These simulations calculate the evolution of dark matter, gas, and stars according to the relevant physics (e.g. gravity, hydrodynamics, star formation, feedback, etc.). \n",
      "Cosmological galaxy formation simulations have been used to understand the CGM in a variety of ways, from analyses of the dynamics of the CGM in simulations~\\citep[e.g.][]{Keres2005, Keres2009, Faucher-Giguere2011a, 2011MNRAS.414.2458V, Nelson2013, Oppenheimer2010, Wetzel2015, Oppenheimer2018} to those that use simulations to provide context to observations~\\citep[e.g.][]{Faucher-Giguere2010, Faucher-Giguere2011,Hummels2013,Liang2015,Corlies2016, 2016MNRAS.462.2440T, Gutcke2017, Nelson2017, Roca-Fabrega2018}.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our analysis makes use of high-resolution cosmological ``zoom-in'' simulations \\citep[][]{1993ApJ...412..455K, 2014MNRAS.437.1894O} created as part of the FIRE project\\footnote{\\url{https://fire.northwestern.edu/}}~\\citep[][]{Hopkins2014,Hopkins2017}.\n",
      "It is particularly instructive to study CGM gas flows in the FIRE simulations because they generate galactic winds whose properties are not put in by hand, but rather emerge from energy/momentum injection by stellar feedback on the scale of star-forming regions. \n",
      "The FIRE simulations have been used to investigate the dynamics of gas flows in the CGM~\\citep{Muratov2015,Muratov2016,Angles-Alcazar2017,Stewart2016} and the observability of the CGM through \\ion{H}{i} and metal absorption, metal-line emission, the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, and X-ray emission~\\citep{Faucher-Giguere2015,Faucher-Giguere2016,Sravan2016,VandeVoort2016,Hafen2016}.\n",
      "The observational comparisons are consistent with observations where constraints are available~\\citep{Faucher-Giguere2015,Faucher-Giguere2016,Hafen2016}.\n",
      "\n",
      "% Particle tracking\n",
      "A powerful aspect of Lagrangian simulations is that they provide access to the full time history of gas resolution elements.\n",
      "Following individual gas elements, or ``particle tracking'', has been used to study the accretion rate onto galaxies and halos,\n",
      "recycling of galactic winds and their effects,\n",
      "and the fate and origin of galaxy material~\\citep[e.g.][]{Keres2005,Oppenheimer2010,Ubler2014,Nelson2015,Angles-Alcazar2017,DeFelippis2017,Oppenheimer2017,Crain2017,Brennan2018}.\n",
      "The primary goal of this work is to use a particle tracking analysis to study the origin of gas and metals in the CGM. \n",
      "Our analysis builds on the analysis of \\cite{Angles-Alcazar2017}, who developed a particle tracking algorithm suitable for use on FIRE simulations and who used it to investigate the origin of baryons in galaxies, linking baryon cycling processes to the mass assembly of galaxies.\n",
      "\\cite{Muratov2015} and \\cite{Muratov2016} also studied the gas and metal content in the CGM of the FIRE simulations, but using instantaneous mass flow rates instead of particle tracking. \n",
      "Our analysis is similar to that of~\\cite{Ford2014}, but also includes mass acquired through satellite galaxies and their winds.\n",
      "Moreover, our zoom-in simulations have higher resolution and model galaxy formation physics using very different subgrid models than the full-volume simulations analyzed by \\cite{Ford2014}.\n",
      "We focus our analysis on $z=0.25$ and $z=2$ to connect to a wide variety of observations available at these redshifts~\\citep[e.g.][]{Tumlinson2013,Steidel2010, Prochaska2017,Rudie2012,OMeara2013,Lehner2016,Chen2018}.\n",
      "\n",
      "% Broad intro to absorption line spectroscopy\n",
      "The primary observational method for studying CGM gas is through absorption line spectroscopy~\\citep[e.g.,][]{Bahcall1969a}.\n",
      "Observations with ground-based telescopes can measure ions in the CGM at both low and high redshifts~\\citep[e.g.][]{2006ApJ...637..648S,2010ApJ...724L.176C, Steidel2010,Rudie2012, Kacprzak2012}.\n",
      "In the last decade, new observations have been enabled at low redshift by the installation of the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph \\citep{Green2012} to the \\textit{Hubble Space Telescope} \\citep[e.g.][]{Tumlinson2013,Werk2014,Liang2014,Johnson2017,Keeney2017}.\n",
      "\n",
      "% Metallicity\n",
      "The interpretation of absorption line spectroscopy is complicated by its one-dimensional nature, which makes it difficult to distinguish CGM gas of  different physical origins.\n",
      "One proposed diagnostic for distinguishing between origins is through the metallicity of the gas, assuming IGM accretion, satellite material, and winds are enriched by different amounts~\\citep[e.g.][]{Lehner2013,Fox2013,Wotta2016,Fumagalli2016,Hafen2016,Lehner2016,Prochaska2017}.\n",
      "Observations indicate a wide range of CGM metallicities (spanning $>2$ dex), which may reflect different origins~\\citep[e.g.][though see Stern et al. 2016 who use multi-density ionization modeling and infer a significantly narrower metallicity distribution]{Lehner2013,Fumagalli2016,Wotta2016,Prochaska2017,Zahedy2018}.\n",
      "Because observations alone do not unambiguously associate absorption systems with specific physical origins, simulation analyses like ours play a key role in developing observational diagnostics \\citep[for a review of efforts in this area, see][]{2017ASSL..430..271F}.\n",
      "\n",
      "We consider three main physically distinct origins for CGM gas:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\begin{enumerate}\n",
      "\n",
      "%% IGM accretion\n",
      "\\item The first origin we consider is accretion into the CGM from the IGM, hereafter referred to as \\textit{IGM accretion}.\n",
      "Some IGM accretion may fall spherically onto dark matter halos and generate a quasi-spherical shock~\\citep{White1978,White1991}, while other accretion can penetrate into the halo in the form of cold streams~\\citep[e.g.][]{Keres2005,Keres2009a,2009Natur.457..451D}.\n",
      "IGM accretion is often assumed to be metal poor and provide a source of new gas to galaxies and their halos, as needed to sustain star formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "%% Galactic winds\n",
      "\\item The second origin is ejection into the CGM via winds from the central galaxy~\\citep[e.g.][]{Heckman2017}, hereafter referred to simply as \\textit{wind}.\n",
      "Simulations show that winds regulate star formation and help produce galaxies that match the observed stellar mass-halo mass relation~\\citep[e.g.][]{2007ApJ...655L..17B,2011MNRAS.416.1354D,Angles-Alcazar2014,Somerville2015}.\n",
      "Material ejected in a wind may then recycle back onto the galaxy as ``wind recycling'' or a ``galactic fountain'' \\citep[e.g.][]{Shapiro1976,Bregman1980,Oppenheimer2010,Ford2014,Angles-Alcazar2017}.\n",
      "\n",
      "%% Satellite winds\n",
      "\\item The third origin is arrival into the CGM via a galaxy other than the main galaxy.\n",
      "For clarity, we divide this origin up into material that has since left the other galaxy (\\textit{satellite wind}), and material that is within the virial radius of the central galaxy's halo but also in the ISM of another galaxy (\\textit{satellite ISM}).\n",
      "We include satellite ISM as a CGM component even though it is not diffuse halo gas because satellite ISM can contribute to absorption systems commonly used to probe the CGM observationally. \n",
      "It is therefore useful to quantify its contribution to galaxy halos. \n",
      "We will show that satellite ISM is a relatively minor component of the CGM by mass so including it does not significantly skew any of our results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because massive galaxies can host substantial populations of satellites, gas associated with satellite galaxies or their halos could be a significant contribution to the CGM. \n",
      "Gas ejected in winds from satellites can exist outside of the satellite for an extended period of time, and can also smoothly accrete onto the central galaxy and fuel in-situ star formation, which has been identified as an important growth mode for massive galaxies.\n",
      "\\cite{Angles-Alcazar2017} showed that this ``intergalactic transfer'' of gas via winds can account for $\\sim 1/3$ of the $z=0$ stellar content of Milky-Way mass galaxies in FIRE-1 simulations.\n",
      "In this paper, we quantify the contribution of ISM gas ejected from satellites to the CGM of central galaxies. \n",
      "Although we use the designation ``satellite wind,'' gas can leave a satellite not only via galactic outflows from the satellite~\\citep[e.g.][]{Wang1993,Barger2016,McClure-Griffiths2018}, but also via ram pressure stripping~\\citep[e.g.][]{Gunn1972,Tonnesen2010,Yun2018} or tidal stripping~\\citep[e.g.][]{Connors2006}.\n",
      "The Magellanic Stream in the halo of our own Galaxy is likely a result of one or multiple of these processes~\\citep[e.g.][]{DOnghia2016,Bustard2018}.\n",

      "We use a sample of cosmological hydrodynamic ``zoom-in'' simulations created as part of the FIRE project.\n",
      "The simulations were run with the multi-method gravity and hydrodynamics code \\textsc{GIZMO}\\footnote{\\url{http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/\\~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html}}~\\citep{Hopkins2015} in its meshless finite-mass (``MFM'') mode.\n",
      "The MFM method is a Lagrangian method using Riemann solvers.\n",
      "The method conserves mass, energy, and linear momentum to machine precision, and also conserves angular momentum. \n",
      "In MFM, the hydrodynamic solver is designed such that there is no mass flux between resolution elements; particle tracking can therefore be straightforwardly implemented by following resolution elements. \n",
      "\\footnote{This is true modulo mass that can be added to gas resolution elements as a result of stellar mass loss, and particle splitting that can occur to prevent resolution elements from becoming too massive.\n",
      "We discard particles that experience splitting, which we do not expect to significantly affect our results (e.g. for all simulations $<\\maxpercentsplitCGMlow\\%$ of gas resolution elements in the CGM at $z=0.25$ are split).} \n",
      "In a variety of tests, MFM has been shown to perform better than smoothed-particle hydrodynamics methods~\\citep{Hopkins2015}.\n",
      "\\textsc{GIZMO} solves gravity using a heavily-modified version of the Tree-PM solver used in \\textsc{GADGET-3}~\\citep{Springel2005}, updated to use adaptive gravitational softening for gas. \n",
      "The particular sample of simulations used in our analysis was run with the FIRE-2 version of GIZMO~\\citep{Hopkins2017}. \n",
      "In most cases, the main halo was chosen solely based on halo mass, however \\texttt{m12r\\_md} and \\texttt{m12w\\_md} were chosen to have an LMC-mass satellite at $z=0$.\n",
      "We find that this selection does not significantly affect our analysis; \n",

      "% Metal diffusion\n",
      "A subset of our simulations utilize a sub-grid model for metal transport between neighboring resolution elements (see Table~\\ref{table:simulations_used}).\n",
      "The purpose of the model is to capture sub-resolution-level metal diffusion that is not by default accounted for by the MFM hydrodynamic solver. \n",
      "Our metal transport model is described in detail in \\cite{Hopkins2017a} and \\cite{Hopkins2017}, but we summarize the most important aspects here.\n",
      "The model assumes that the transport of metals between neighboring resolution elements follows a diffusion equation, $\\partial_t ( \\rho Z ) = \\nabla \\cdot ( \\kappa \\rho \\nabla Z ) $, where $\\rho$ is the density, $Z$ is the metallicity, and $\\kappa$ is the relevant diffusion coefficient.\n",
      "The primary assumption for the metal diffusion model is that the diffusion timescale scales with the eddy turnover time of the largest unresolved turbulent eddies, i.e. that unresolved turbulence exchanges metals between resolution elements.\n",
      "This means $\\kappa \\sim \\kappa_{\\rm turb} \\sim \\lambda_{\\rm eddy} v_{\\rm eddy}$, where $\\kappa_{\\rm turb}$ is the ``eddy diffusivity'' calculated via the \\cite{Smagorinsky1963} approximation~\\citep[e.g.][]{Shen2010}.\n",
      "This approximation is appropriate under certain conditions usually met in our simulations, but if these conditions are violated then the diffusivity can be significantly overestimated~\\citep[e.g.][]{Colbrook2017}.\n",
      "Our subgrid prescription caps the diffusivity at the equivalent value allowed in the meshless finite-volume (``MFV'') mode of GIZMO, which explicitly allow mass-flux between elements. \n",
      "This diffusivity (and the diffusivity that occurs in other grid-based codes) generally overestimates the true physical diffusivity. \n",
      "For galaxies up to $\\sim L^{\\star}$ simulated in the cosmological context, previous tests suggest that including subgrid turbulent metal diffusion has mostly negligible effects on the dynamical evolution of galaxies \\citep[e.g.,][]{Su2016}, but the dynamical effects could be more important for more massive galaxies which develop hot halos whose cooling can be modified substantially by metal mixing. \n",
      "Unsurprisingly, turbulent metal diffusion can have large effects on metallicity distributions of gas and stars in both the ISM and CGM~\\citep[e.g.,][]{Escala2018, Rennehan2018}, and so it is important to investigate its effects on CGM properties.\n",

      "For each simulation in our sample, we analyze the CGM of that simulation's main halo and its origins at two main cosmic times: one at $z=0.25$ and one at $z=2$.\n",
      "At low redshift, $z=0.25$ is a redshift representative of many observational studies of the CGM with the Hubble Space Telescope ~\\citep[e.g.][]{Lehner2013, Tumlinson2013,Werk2014,Stocke2014,Prochaska2017,Chen2018}.\n",
      "Meanwhile, $z=2$ is the peak of cosmic star formation, a critical point for understanding galaxy growth, and is a regime where we can probe the CGM with ground-based observatories~\\citep[e.g.][]{2006ApJ...637..648S,Steidel2010,Rudie2012,OMeara2013}.\n",
      "For each targeted redshift snapshot we identify all gas particles that have a radial distance from the center of the main galaxy of $(0.1-1) R_{\\rm vir}$, and then randomly sample $10^5$ of those particles (in our simulations the CGM contains $\\sim 10^6 - 10^7$ particles, so downsampling reduces memory usage while maintaining a statistically robust sample).\n",
      "Note that when $R_{\\rm gal} > 0.1 R_{\\rm vir}$ particles within $R_{\\rm gal}$ are not actually classified as part the CGM in our analysis, as explained in~\\S\\ref{sec:galdef}. \n",
      "Because the gas particles have approximately constant mass (there are some variations owing to mass loss from stellar evolution, which can increase the mass of gas neighbors), a random sample of particles is nearly equivalent to a mass-weighted sample.\n",
      "For each particle we compile the full history of the particle's temperature, density, metallicity, position, velocity, particle type (i.e. star or gas), mass, and star formation rate at each snapshot of the simulation.\n",
      "The time difference between snapshots is $\\sim 10-25$ Myr.\n",
      "We combine this information with the halo catalog produced by AHF to identify each particle's proximity to the main galaxy as well as the nearest galaxy other than the main galaxy.\n",
      "In addition to analyzing snapshots at $z=0.25$ and $z=2$ for all simulations in our sample, we study the redshift evolution of the CGM by analyzing 25 additional snapshots from $z=0$ to $z=3$ for a subset of our simulations.\n",
      "Specifically, we analyze in more detail simulations \\texttt{m12i}, \\texttt{m11q}, and \\texttt{m10y} as representatives of $10^{12}$, $10^{11}$ and $10^{10} M_\\odot$ progenitors respectively.\n",

      "% How do we classify?\n",
      "Figure~\\ref{fig:CGM_origins} summarizes how we classify the origin of CGM gas in our analysis.\n",
      "Consider a Lagrangian particle in the CGM of the main halo at a redshift $z$. \n",
      "We first consider whether or not this particle has spent more than a pre-processing time $t_{\\rm pro}$ in any galaxy prior to $z$.\n",
      "Following \\cite{Angles-Alcazar2017}, if the particle has not spent $t_{\\rm pro}$ in other galaxies, then its origin is \\textit{IGM accretion}.\n",
      "The pre-processing time $t_{\\rm pro}$ is taken to be slightly larger than the maximum time interval between snapshots, i.e. $t_{\\rm pro}=30$ Myr.\n",
      "This takes advantage of the higher output frequency in our simulations compared to \\cite{Angles-Alcazar2017}~(where $t_{\\rm pro}$ was set to $100$ Myr).\n",
      "Note that gas that has been in or is in the halo of another galaxy can still be classified as IGM accretion, provided it did not enter or spend significant time inside the galaxy itself.\n",
      "While some very small halos exist below our resolution limit, star formation in these halos should be strongly suppressed by the UV background, so these halos should not process the gas. \n",
      "If the particle is processed, we determine whether or not it is currently, at $z$, inside another galaxy.\n",
      "If it is inside another galaxy at $z$, then we classify it as belonging to \\textit{satellite ISM}.\n",
      "If not then we find whether the particle last left the main galaxy or a satellite galaxy.\n",
      "If it last left the main galaxy the particle is classified as \\textit{wind}.\n",
      "If it last left a satellite galaxy the particle is classified as \\textit{satellite wind}.\n",
      "Note that gas classified as satellite wind could also have arrived in the CGM through tidal or ram pressure stripping from a satellite galaxy, or could have arrived in the CGM after being ejected by another galaxy not currently in the CGM and that may not become a satellite. \n",
      "We use the term satellite wind because the majority of this material arrives in the CGM after having been ejected from a satellite galaxy in a wind (see \\S\\ref{sec:particle_pathlines}).\n",
      "The classifications described here are for a particular moment in time, and a gas particle can change classifications over time, e.g. gas that is first classified as IGM accretion before later being ejected in a galactic wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout this work we focus on understanding the properties of gas according to its \\emph{most recent} origin, as for many purposes this is most informative. \n",
      "For example, winds may return into the CGM gas that accreted onto the central galaxy as IGM accretion or satellite wind.\n",
      "However, to understand the effects of this gas on CGM dynamics and enrichment it is important to recognize that this wind gas carries energy and metals recently output by the central galaxy.\n",

      "The baryonic mass of $10^{10} M_\\odot$ halos is well below the universal baryon fraction because their potential can be too shallow to accrete photo-heated gas effectively~\\citep[e.g.][]{Thoul1996, Gnedin2000, Okamoto2008, Faucher-Giguere2011,El-Badry2017} and to hold onto any wind, which is expelled from these halos more efficiently than in higher mass halos~\\citep[e.g.][]{Muratov2015}.\n",

      "In a few situations the main galaxy is about to undergo a major merger with another galaxy. \n",

      "The halo metal mass is a larger fraction of its metal budget, $y_{\\rm box} M_\\star$, than is the halo baryon mass relative to the cosmic baryon budget. \n",
      "This suggests that winds, which carry much of the metals, preferentially remain in the halo. \n",
      "As discussed by \\cite{Muratov2016}, this is because galactic winds sweep up halo gas (most of which is contributed by IGM accretion), preferentially ejecting relatively metal-poor gas from halos. \n",
      "Further, metal-enriched winds cool more rapidly, which may increase the recycling of winds onto galaxies. \n",
      "\n",
      "% Breakdown of categories for metal mass\n",
      "Compared to the baryon mass, the CGM typically contains a smaller fraction of the halo metal mass: as little as $\\sim$\\fmetCGMMWmeanlow\\% of the halo metal mass (again for $10^{12} M_\\odot$ progenitors at $z=0.25$), but up to $\\sim$\\fmetCGMdwarfmeanhigh\\% for $10^{10} M_\\odot$ progenitors at $z=2$.\n",
      "This is explained by the fact that a large fraction of the CGM mass comes from metal-poor IGM accretion (\\S\\ref{sec:origin_by_mass}), while metals are produced in galaxies and then potentially expelled as winds.\n",
      "The contribution of the galaxy-halo interface to the halo metal mass is on average higher than its contribution to the halo baryon mass, and can contribute up to $\\sim$\\fmetinterfacedwarfmeanhigh\\% in the case of  $10^{10} M_\\odot$ progenitors at $z=2$.\n",

The circle is rotated such that the normal is parallel to the total angular momentum of the galaxy's stars, indicating the orientation of the galactic disk.\n",

      "As can be seen from Figure~\\ref{fig:pathlines_CGM_snum465}, at $z=0.25$ most of the volume of the three halos shown is filled with particle trajectories that overlap in complex patterns.\n",
      "These particles come from different origins, and are mixed together relatively well.\n",
      "These particles are part of the CGM's diffuse halo gas, i.e. they are not part of any substructure or satellite galaxy, which is $\\gtrsim 60\\%$ of the CGM by mass by $z=0.25$ for all analyzed halos (Appendix \\ref{sec:mass_by_phase}).\n",

      "Overall, this this selection reveals more coherent gas flows before they have time to become well-mixed with the CGM.\n",
      "\n",
      "% IGM Anisotropy\n",
      "For all the simulations shown, recent IGM accretion is highly anisotropic at $z \\approx 2$, consistent with the expected filamentary accretion at high redshift \\citep[e.g.,][]{Keres2005, Dekel2006, 2011MNRAS.412L.118F}. \n",
      "By $z=0.25$, IGM accretion remains significantly anisotropic but overall much less so.\n",
      "In the case of \\texttt{m12i} at $z=1.5$, the dominant direction of IGM accretion is associated with other infalling structures, as can be seen by the co-aligned gas overdensity and satellite wind.\n",
      "This is not surprising, because filamentary structures that build halos bring in both IGM accretion and satellite galaxies.\n",
      "For \\texttt{m10y} at $z=0.25$, the location of the gas changes only slightly over the course of 1 Gyr, as can be seen by the very short length of the pathlines.\n",
      "This is because the potentials of the $10^{10}M_\\odot$ halos are shallow enough that photo-heated gas in the IGM does not accrete strongly onto the halo.\n",
      "\n",
      "% Radial distance plots\n",
      "To complement the 2D projections, Figures~\\ref{fig:r_vs_time_m12i_CGM_snum465}, \\ref{fig:r_vs_time_m11q_CGM_snum465}, and \\ref{fig:r_vs_time_m10y_CGM_snum465} show the radial distance from the main galaxy of \\texttt{m12i}, \\texttt{m11q}, \\texttt{m10y}, respectively, as a function of time for 10 randomly-selected particles per classification found in the CGM at $z=0.25$.\n",
      "For these plots we do not show the paths traced by particles that are classified as satellite ISM, because such gas makes up a small fraction of the total halo gas mass.\n",
      "These figures show that particles initially follow the cosmological expansion (moving radially outward), before reaching a turnaround radius.\n",
      "This is reminiscent of the spherical collapse of halo formation \\citep[][]{1972ApJ...176....1G}. \n",
      "For \\texttt{m12i}, IGM accretion can fall in from over 500 proper kpc away; this is a measure of the Lagrangian volume of the Universe contributing to the assembly of the halo.\n",
      "We now highlight some characteristics of the different modes of CGM assembly illustrated by particle trajectories.\n",
      "\n",
      "% Satellite wind\n",
      "As expected, satellite wind is associated with galaxies other than the main central galaxies. \n",
      "Note that the renderings in Figures~\\ref{fig:pathlines_CGM_snum465} and \\ref{fig:pathlines_CGM_snum172} show the location of stars at the current (target) redshift but the particle trajectories show past behavior, and therefore in the right column the white parts of the particle trajectories converge where the galaxy was located in the past. \n",
      "This is why the points of origin of satellite wind do not in general coincide with the location of stellar clumps. \n",
      "Interestingly, the images show that in many cases (especially at $z\\approx 2$) satellite wind gas was actually ejected before the source entered the main halo, i.e. the source galaxy only later becomes a satellite of the main central galaxy. \n",
      "An extreme case is \\texttt{m10y} at $z=2$, where the majority of the satellite wind in the halo was forcibly ejected from the halo of another galaxy $\\sim 50$ kpc away.\n",
      "On the other hand, gas removed from other galaxies primarily through stripping appears to be less common, thus the name ``satellite wind.''\n",
      "Also as expected, the radial distance plots in Figures~\\ref{fig:r_vs_time_m12i_CGM_snum465} and~\\ref{fig:r_vs_time_m11q_CGM_snum465} show that the histories of particles are more highly correlated in the case of satellite wind compared to IGM accretion (which can originate from directions other than from other galaxies). \n",
      "\n",
      "% Wind dynamics\n",
      "Wind from the main galaxy often undergoes frequent recycling.\n",
      "Some of these recycling periods are short, $\\lesssim 100$ Myr, while others can be as long as 10 Gyrs (see \\citealt{Angles-Alcazar2017}).\n",
      "Once out of the galaxy, wind can remain in the halo for billions of years at a time.\n",
      "This occurs for other modes of CGM growth as well.\n",
      "As can be seen in Figures~\\ref{fig:r_vs_time_m12i_CGM_snum465} and~\\ref{fig:r_vs_time_m11q_CGM_snum465}, some of the IGM accretion gas in the CGM of \\texttt{m12i} and \\texttt{m11q} at $z=0.25$ was in the CGM previously, but was pushed out by winds before eventually reentering $R_{\\rm vir}$.\n",
      "This is most clearly seen for gas particles that start at a radii $r_0$ from the central galaxy, begin to accrete, and instead turn around and reach radii $r > r_0$, suggesting energy injection.\n",
      "This ``preventative feedback'' is especially visible in the visualizations of \\texttt{m11q} near $z=0.25$ because the halo is undergoing a strong outflow event at that redshift.\n",
      "In this case, wind from the central galaxy is pushing out and reversing some of the recent IGM accretion, and may also interact significantly with wind from the satellite. \n",
      "Wind is also found on average closer to the central galaxy compared to the other origins, as discussed in \\S\\ref{sec:origin_by_radius}.\n",
      "As found in previous analyses of the FIRE simulations ~\\citep[e.g.][]{Muratov2015,Faucher-Giguere2015}, strong outflows can suppress infall onto galaxies and cause temporary decreases in the star formation rate.\n",

      "Note that we include gas belonging to satellite galaxies (satellite ISM) as part of the CGM in this plot, even though it is not diffuse halo gas in a strict sense. \n",
      "We do this because satellite ISM can contribute to absorption systems commonly used to probe the CGM observationally, and so it is useful to know how much of it is present in galaxy halos. \n",

      "% Discussion of results w/o diffusion\n",
      "We separately show trends with halo mass for the CGM metal mass fractions for the simulations with and without subgrid metal diffusion. \n",
      "We stress that the interpretation differs between the two sets of results.\n",
      "For the simulations without subgrid metal diffusion, the CGM metal mass fractions most directly measure \\emph{where metals in the CGM were produced}. \n",
      "This is because in the simulations without subgrid diffusion particles can only accumulate metals by direct contact with stellar processes that produce metals (stellar winds and supernovae).\n",
      "In this case the mass fractions are dominated by winds from the central galaxy, winds from satellites, and satellite ISM. \n",
      "As we will show more directly in \\S \\ref{sec:metallicity}, even in the simulations without subgrid metal diffusion gas classified as IGM accretion can have a metallicity greater than the metallicity floor. \n",
      "This enrichment can occur via halo stars and brief interactions with other galaxies (too short for our algorithm to classify the particles as having been processed by other galaxies).\n",
      "\n",
      "% Interpretation of metal diffusion results\n",
      "The CGM metal mass fraction in subgrid metal diffusion simulations includes both metals directly accumulated by interactions with star particles as well as through diffusion of metals from neighbor gas particles, which can have a different origin. \n",
      "The subgrid metal diffusion process does not change the CGM origin categories in our particle tracking analysis. \n",
      "Thus, when subgrid metal diffusion is include, the CGM origin category does not necessarily reflect where the metal mass carried by a gas particle were produced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although simulations with subgrid metal diffusion ``lose'' some information on the history of a particle's metals, they are very useful to include in our analysis, for a few reasons.\n",
      "First, the subgrid metal diffusion prescription in FIRE-2 simulations has been shown to be necessary in order to produce realistic stellar metallicity distributions \\citep[][]{Escala2018}, and the same may be true for the CGM. To connect with metallicities inferred with observations, it is thus important to explore the effects of subgrid metal diffusion on our results. \n",
      "Second, our model for subgrid metal diffusion is approximate (as are all such models), which introduces significant uncertainties in our predictions \\citep[e.g.][]{Rennehan2018}. \n",
      "Including both simulations with and without this subgrid model in our analysis allows us to gauge these uncertainties. For example, the difference in a given origin's CGM metal mass between simulations of similar mass halos with/without metal diffusion is a measure of the metal fraction due to metal return by stellar processes vs. subgrid mixing with neighbors.\\footnote{We note, however, that this measure is imperfect due to variance between different halos and the fact that subgrid metal diffusion can also introduce some dynamical differences through cooling.}\n",
      "\n",
      "% Discussion of results w/ diffusion\n",
      "Subgrid metal diffusion primarily affects the metal mass content of gas accreted from the IGM. \n",
      "This is because these particles experience no or little direct interactions with star particles. \n",
      "When subgrid metal diffusion is included, the diffusion enrichment process rapidly becomes important.\n",
      "At $z=0.25$, the metal mass fraction in IGM accretion in the $M_{\\rm h}\\sim 10^{12}$ M$_{\\odot}$ halos can be $\\sim 1-2$ dex higher than in similar runs without subgrid metal diffusion.\n",
      "Despite large fractional changes in metallicity, this enhancement generally occurs through the diffusion of a relatively small absolute metal mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "% IGM accretion w/ diffusion\n",
      "Subgrid metal diffusion also appears to have a major effect on the halo mass dependence of the IGM accretion metal mass fraction, which has strong positive slope with increasing halo mass at $z=0.25$ in the simulations with subgrid metal diffusion. \n",
      "The fact that the effects of subgrid metal diffusion are strongest for the most massive halos and at late times suggests that the magnitude of the effect is enhanced by the presence of a virialized hot halo into which metals can diffuse efficiently from winds (the more massive halos at low redshifts are the ones which sustain the most substantial hot halos).\n",

      "These origins include IGM accretion, wind from the central galaxy, and wind from satellites. \n",
      "Our results indicate that this issue will especially complicate the interpretation of low-redshift observations, as $z \\sim 0.25$ halos are predicted to be more throughly mixed than $z\\sim 2$ halos. \n",
      "With regards to detecting galactic winds, our analysis confirms results previously obtained using FIRE-1 simulations. \n",
      "Namely, winds from $\\sim L^{\\star}$ galaxies should be easier to detect in the CGM of high-redshift star-forming galaxies (i.e., Lyman break galaxies) as galactic winds become much weaker for $\\sim L^{\\star}$ galaxies at $z \\lesssim 1$ \\citep[e.g.,][]{Muratov2015, Angles-Alcazar2017}. \n",
      "Figure \\ref{fig:CGM_mass_frac_profile} shows that this is also the case for the FIRE-2 simulations analyzed in this paper: the CGM mass fraction from the winds of central galaxies for $M_{\\rm h} \\sim 10^{12}$ M$_{\\odot}$ progenitors is much larger at $\\sim R_{\\rm vir}$ at $z=2$ than at $z=0.25$.\n",

      "% Summary of observational results for angular absorption\n",
      "Some observations of absorption equivalent width as a function of azimuthal angle relative to the galaxy semi-minor axis suggest a bimodal or otherwise aspherical distribution, which could be due to different physical processes~\\citep[e.g.,][]{Bordoloi2011,Bouche2012,Bordoloi2014,Kacprzak2015,Ho2016}.\n",
      "In addition, the ongoing Project AMIGA will constrain the geometry of the CGM of M31 with nearly 50 sight lines~\\citep[][]{2015ApJ...804...79L, Howk2017}. \n",
      "As discussed in \\S\\ref{sec:origin_by_angle}, we find that while warm/hot ($T > 10^{4.7}$ K) gas is distributed approximately spherically around low-redshift $\\sim L^{\\star}$ galaxies, cold/cool gas ($T < 10^{4.7}$ K) appears preferentially located near disk plane of galaxies (albeit with large halo-to-halo variations).\n",
      "In order to determine the observational signatures expected from the distributions found in the simulations, it would be beneficial to produce mock absorption spectra, as well as to analyze a larger simulation sample to better understand the expected scatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "% Metallicity of individual components\n",
      "The metallicity of a CGM absorber is often discussed as a diagnostic of its physical nature, with high-column but metal-poor systems often associated with fresh IGM accretion \\citep[e.g.,][]{2011ApJ...743..207R, 2011Sci...334.1245F,Fumagalli2016a}. \n",
      "In \\cite{Hafen2016} we studied the FIRE-1 simulations and found that metallicity is in general a poor diagnostic of inflows and outflows as defined purely based on radial kinematics relative to central galaxies. \n",
      "This is in part because the prevalence of wind recycling implies that metal-rich wind gas often later falls back onto the galaxy from which it was ejected. \n",
      "By classifying IGM accretion and wind gas in the CGM not based on instantaneous radial kinematics but instead using particle tracking, we can revisit the question of metallicity as a diagnostic of CGM gas origin. \n",
      "For example, the metallicity distributions in Figure \\ref{fig:CGM_metallicity} indicate that at $z=0.25$ most CGM gas with $Z \\lesssim 10^{-2}Z_\\odot$ is associated with IGM accretion, in the case of simulations without subgrid metal diffusion. \n",
      "However, similar to what was found by \\cite{Hafen2016}, more metal-rich gas can arise either in IGM accretion or in winds, if metal diffusion in the CGM is accurately captured by our subgrid prescription.\n",

      "As another result from \\cite{Hafen2016}, we found that for similarly-selected absorbers the CGM across a wide range of halo masses contributed to the observed metallicity distribution, which produced a distribution without a statistically significant metallicity bi-modality (although our modest sample of zoom-in simulations introduced significant noise in the analysis). \n",
      "The lack of a clear metallicity dip appears in conflict with the analysis of the above observational studies~\\citep[see also][]{Rahmati2018}.\n",
      "Our particle tracking results suggest a similar conclusion: while different origins have different metallicities, the halo mass range induces a $\\gtrsim 1$ dex spread in metallicities for a given origin (see Figure~\\ref{fig:CGM_metallicity}).\n",

      "Using the galaxy growth particle tracking analysis of \\cite{Angles-Alcazar2017} as a starting point, we tracked the trajectories of CGM gas elements throughout the full duration of each simulation (i.e. their pathlines).\n",

      "The CGM mass is $\\sim$\\fCGMMWmeanlow-\\fCGMdwarfmeanlow\\% of the baryonic mass retained within the virial radius of the halo baryon; on average, the halo mass fraction in the CGM increases with decreasing halo mass.\n",
      "\\item A significant fraction ($\\gtrsim 20$\\%) of the metals produced by stars within halos escape the virial radius in most halos analyzed (Figure~\\ref{fig:metal_mass_budget}). \n",
      "The main exception are $M_{\\rm h}\\sim 10^{12}$ M$_{\\odot}$ at $z\\sim0.25$. \n",
      "In general, the metal mass fraction ``lost'' from halos increases with decreasing halo mass. \n",
      "In low-redshift $\\sim L^{\\star}$ halos, most of the metals are located in the central galaxy, consistent with efficient recycling of wind ejecta. \n",
      "\\item Across all halo masses and redshifts considered, IGM accretion provides $\\sim 60-80\\%$ of the CGM gas mass at $R \\sim R_{\\rm vir}$, but $\\sim 40-80 \\%$ of the gas in the inner CGM ($0.1R_{\\rm vir}<R<0.5R_{\\rm vir}$) has recycled through the central galaxy and is classified as wind (Figure~\\ref{fig:CGM_mass_frac_profile}).\n",

      "The CGM mass is, as a whole, distributed with approximately constant mass per $\\Delta R$, corresponding to a volume-weighted average density profile $n_{\\rm H} \\propto R^{-2}$ (Figure~\\ref{fig:CGM_den_profile}). \n",
      "\\item Wind and gas otherwise removed from satellites is not only a major contributer to the growth of central galaxies~\\citep{Angles-Alcazar2017}, but can also contribute as much (or more) mass to the CGM as wind from the central galaxy for $M_{\\rm h} \\sim 10^{12} M_\\odot$ halos at $z\\sim0.25$ (Figure~\\ref{fig:CGM_mass_frac_vs_Mh_CGM}). \n",

      "\\item The metallicity distribution of IGM accretion gas particles is systematically lower than the metallicity distributions of winds (typically by $\\gtrsim 1$ dex in the median), although actual values of gas metallicity in the CGM and IGM depend significantly on the treatment of subgrid metal diffusion (Figure~\\ref{fig:CGM_metallicity}).\n",
      "The mean wind metallicity increases with increasing halo mass.\n",
      "The overall CGM metallicity decreases with increasing radius, which is driven by an increasing mass fraction contributed by low-metallicity IGM accretion and a decreasing mass fraction contributed by more enriched winds (Figure~\\ref{fig:CGM_met_profiles}).\n",
